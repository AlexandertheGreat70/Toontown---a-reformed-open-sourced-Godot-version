Toontown - A newly reformed version

Toons, remember that Disney originally made, along with their interactive department and Schell Games, Toontown Online. With that in mind, let me say that the world of Toontown needs a better coat of paint through controversy after controversy after controversy. At the moment, I am still setting things up for an extensive game filled with Adventure and Role-Playing similar to the original Toontown. Anyone is welcome to help out with this game. Much appreciated. Contact me at ttrdatabase1@gmail.com for now if you have anything to say.
